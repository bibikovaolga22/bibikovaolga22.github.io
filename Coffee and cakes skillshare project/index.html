            <h1>PROBLEM OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>The core idea of the current project was to create a mobile app that would help people to make their
                order quickly and efficiently. In order to be clear about what I want to do in my project
                in the very beginning I started with scoping the topic and identifying what actually I am going to make.

                <h4>Build a mobile app for different people of different social groups (students, workers, retired
                    people) who use delivery services for getting coffee(drinks) and sweets during their work and
                    leisure time.</h4>

        <article id="double-dimond">
            <p>Also to determine my strategy of the design I used Double Dimond design model. This model serves as a map
                that
                helps me to organize my thoughts in order to improve the creative process. I included there necessary
                methods an deliverables to be used in each stage of the design procedure. </p>

            <h1>RESEARCH AND SYNTHESIS</h1>
            <p>The user research is a milestone of the user-centered design(UCD) approach. It's essential part of the
                design that enables to define user's needs, behavors and pain points and in consiquence
                allows to achieve better results of the final product performence.In order to to capture and explore the
                reaction and behaviors of the users and also to make clear the unknown
                I conducted qualitative research - 30 minutes of online semi-structured interview with 4 users involved.
                Basically the main outcome of the research was that
                users wish to get their order delivered to them as soon as possible. It was also important for the users
                they could see discriptive information about the products they wanted to buy. <br>
                You can see the full research script <a href="research script.pdf" target="blank">here.</a> According to
                the data gathered during the research I
                reframed the insight statements as "HMW" questions, e.g "How might we help users to make their orders as
                quickly as possible" or "How might we
                provide users with descriptive information about the products they try to order " etc.

        <article id="user-testing">
            <h1>USER TESTING AND ITERATION</h1>
            <p>User -Testing is another importent part of the design process.
                This technique allowes to check how usable the interface is.
                It reduces the risks of building the wrong product, finds the
                problems on the early stage of the process when it's easy and cheap to fix them and
                also saves money and time.The user-testing pursued the following goals:<br>
                -Validate the design solution<br>
                -Ensure that the content makes sence to the user<br>
                -Validate that the workflow is usable.<br>
                The user-testing was conducted online where the users were asked to describe what they see on the
                screen and answer open-ended questions. Generally the participants
                were satisfied with the low-fidelity interface and the user-flow was completed without
                any interruptions, doubts or problems. The only remark, that the users mentioned in the end
                was 'the ascence of 'heart' icon in coffee menu'. I took it into account and made some
                amendments in the next itteration.You can see full user-testing script <a href="user testing.pdf"

            <h1>OUTCOME</h1>


            <p>-It took me 1 month to finish this end-to-end process. It was extremly importent to set the stratagy of
                the
                design process in the very beginning of the project, define goals and target audience. I was leaning on
                the S.M.A.R.T. framework
                while definig primary objectives and goals to lay out a clear plan before starting to design. <br>


                -I used several techniques and deliverables in the current projects, key of them are: user research,
                affinity mapping,
                sketching, wireframing, prototyping, persona, user-testing.<br>

                - Product goals were reached in the end as a result of the project.
                -The final design solution was made according to the data gathered fron the research.
